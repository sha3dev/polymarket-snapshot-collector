# Project Rules

Read this file together with `AGENTS.md` and `ai/contract.json` before making implementation changes.

## Core Rules

- Treat `ai/contract.json` as the machine-readable source of truth.
- Treat `AGENTS.md` as blocking local policy.
- Keep managed files read-only unless the user explicitly requests a standards update.
- Run `npm run check` yourself before finishing and fix any failures before you stop.

## Refactor Rule

- When working from a legacy codebase or refactor snapshot, you MUST analyze the old code and rebuild a fresh implementation that matches the active standards.
- Legacy code MUST be treated as behavior/reference input, not as a structure to copy into the scaffold.
- You MUST NOT preserve legacy folders, file splits, plural feature names, helper layers, wrappers, or typed errors unless they are both standards-compliant and required by preserved contracts.
- If legacy code conflicts with the scaffold, the scaffold MUST win.

## Simplicity

- Choose the simplest correct design for the current requirement.
- Do not add speculative abstractions, helper layers, wrappers, or extension points without immediate need.
- Do not use simplicity as a reason to remove valid responsibility boundaries.

## Compactness

- If a declaration, expression, call, object literal, array literal, import, or constructor call fits on one line within the configured line limit, it MUST stay on one line.
- Prefer fewer line breaks when readability is preserved.
- Do not split code into multiple lines just because it is “safer”; only split when it no longer fits cleanly or readability would suffer.

## Simple Callbacks

- Simple callbacks in `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `some`, `every`, `find`, and `forEach` MUST use concise arrow functions when the body is a single expression.
- Do not use block-bodied callbacks with explicit `return` for simple expressions.
- If a callback fits on one line, keep it on one line.

## Errors

- Throw plain `Error` by default.
- Use custom error types only when other code must distinguish failure kinds.
- Do not add error hierarchies without a real consumer.

## Type Files

- Keep small or local types close to the code that uses them.
- Create `*.types.ts` only when shared feature types are substantial enough to justify a dedicated file.

## Feature Classes

- Inside `src/<feature>/`, files MUST expose exactly one public class unless the file is `*.types.ts`.
- Do not implement feature modules as exported function collections.
- If a file exposes a public class, helper logic MUST stay inside that class as private or static methods instead of module-scope functions.
- Large classes MUST be decomposed into smaller cohesive units before they become monolithic files.

## README

- Rewrite `README.md` as package-quality integration documentation once real behavior exists.
- Document every public export from `src/index.ts`.
- If a public export is a class, document each public method with purpose, return value, and behavior notes.
- Use a structure inspired by high-quality package READMEs: short value proposition, practical examples first, exhaustive API reference after.
- Do not leave scaffold-placeholder API descriptions once implementation is real.

## Active Deterministic Rules

- `control-flow-braces`: if, else, for, while, and do blocks must always use braces. (verify, confidence: high)
- `concise-simple-callbacks`: Simple callbacks must use concise arrow expressions instead of block bodies with an explicit return. (verify, confidence: high)
- `cross-feature-entrypoint-imports`: Cross-feature imports must go through an explicit feature entrypoint rather than another feature's internal file. (verify, confidence: high)
- `ambiguous-feature-filenames`: Feature code must not use ambiguous file names such as helpers.ts, utils.ts, or common.ts. (verify, confidence: high)
- `typed-error-must-be-used`: Custom error types must be consumed by logic that distinguishes them from plain failures. (verify, confidence: high)
- `no-silent-catch`: Catch blocks must rethrow, transform, or report errors instead of silently swallowing them. (verify, confidence: high)

## Active Heuristic Rules

- `compact-single-line-constructs`: Declarations, calls, imports, arrays, and objects that fit on one line should not be spread across multiple lines. (verify, confidence: high)
- `feature-first-layout`: Projects with feature modules must keep domain code under feature folders instead of mixing flat modules at src/ root. (verify, confidence: medium)
- `restricted-shared-boundaries`: src/app and src/shared should exist only when real composition or cross-feature sharing justifies them. (verify, confidence: medium)
- `types-file-justification`: Dedicated .types.ts files should only exist when they contain substantial shared feature types. (verify, confidence: medium)
- `plain-error-default`: Plain Error must be used by default; custom error types require a real control-flow consumer. (verify, confidence: medium)
- `actionable-error-messages`: Error messages should include actionable context rather than empty or generic text. (verify, confidence: medium)
- `test-determinism-guards`: Tests should avoid uncontrolled time, randomness, real network calls, and un-restored process.env mutation. (verify, confidence: medium)
- `readme-no-placeholder-language`: README content must not look like a scaffold placeholder or contain TODO-style filler text. (verify, confidence: medium)

## Active Audit Rules

- `managed-files-read-only`: Managed contract and tooling files must not be edited during normal feature work. (verify, confidence: medium)
- `behavior-change-tests`: Behavior changes must update or add tests, and tests should focus on observable behavior. (verify, confidence: medium)
- `simplicity-audit`: Projects should avoid needless layers, wrappers, and extra files when a smaller direct implementation would suffice. (verify, confidence: medium)
- `comments-policy-audit`: Non-trivial logic should include explicit comments when the profile requires extensive comments. (verify, confidence: medium)
